The code was used to analyse the loose-seal currents recorded from boutons of cortical boutons. 

The code was run on Mac OSX 11.2.3 and Windows XX after installation of 
- Individual Edition of Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com) for the use of JuyiterLab 2.2.6 
- Python 3.9.4
- and mpl-axes-aligner with "pip install mpl-axes-aligner"

To run the code execute the JupyterLab Notebook file ap.ipynb.
The file "testData_100Hz_train.dat" is an example HEKA file from an experiment with a 100Hz train of 20 action potentials.
The PDF file ap.pdf contains JupyterLab Notebook file with the embedded output graphs.

There is detailed documentation of the Python code in the cells of the JupyterLab Notebook file ap.ipynb. For more information contact hallermann@medizin.uni-leipzig.de
