The code was used to analyse the loose-seal currents recorded from boutons of cortical boutons. 

The code was run on Mac OSX 11.2.3 and Windows XX after installation of 
- Individual Edition of Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com) using JuyiterLab 2.2.6 
- Python 3.9.4
- and mpl-axes-aligner with "pip install mpl-axes-aligner"

There is detailed documentation of the Python code in the cells of the JupyterLab ap.ipynb. For more information contact hallermann@medizin.uni-leipzig.de
